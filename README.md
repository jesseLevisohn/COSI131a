PA1: Implement a Unix shell in Java

PA2: Implement a Unix Shell in Java using threading and concurrency

PA3: Implement a priority scheduler that manages a collection of vehicles attempting to enter a set of tunnels. 
     The priority scheduler mimics the behavior of a CPU scheduler by using synchronization, semaphores, concurrent algorithms, and a scheduling algorithm.
